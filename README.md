### About
This my repo where I store my project files for past projects I did. 

### Task Manager
Built a very simple app that allows users to create and delete tasks. The tasks have a name, a description and an urgency level. The tasks are displayed in a table with the forms to remove and add tasks below. 

### Rebound - (book-adder)
Built a book-trading platform where users can add, delete and trade for books. The listings and trades and are on different pages and the user can navigate between these using the header. The authentication is handled by Firebase.
