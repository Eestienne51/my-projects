As New / New: The book is in perfect, flawless condition, as if it were never used. It may still be in the original shrink-wrap.
Fine (F): The book is nearly new but not quite crisp. It may show very minor signs of handling, but pages are clean and unmarked.
Near Fine (NF): A book that is almost fine but has a couple of very minor, specific defects that a seller should note.
Very Good (VG): Shows some signs of wear, but the book is still attractive. There should be no tears on the binding or paper, but there might be light shelf wear or a former owner's name.
Good (G): A readable book that shows more noticeable wear than a VG copy. It may have highlighting, a loose binding, or a torn dust jacket, but all pages are intact.
Fair (FR): The book is well-worn, but all the text pages are present and readable. It might be missing endpapers or the half-title page, and the binding may be weak.
Poor (P): A heavily worn book where the primary value is the legible text. It may have significant damage, such as missing pages or a damaged binding. This is often called a "reading copy" and is not suitable for collecting.
